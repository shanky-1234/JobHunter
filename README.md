# Jobhunter Project
Jobhunter is a MERN Stack project with authentication for admin and user. The user can upload a resume and apply for jobs whereas admin can make new companies and post a new job opening there

In this project i explored how to handle authentication, multiple user permissions. I learned about how to handle relation with MongoDB and handling middlewares.
